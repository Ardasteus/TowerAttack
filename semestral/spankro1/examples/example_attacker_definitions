This how attacker definitions can look. Everything is pretty self explanatory except the "StrongAgainst" and "WeakAgainst" columns.

If there exists an attacker who has the same string in their "AttackType" columns the damage dealt is mofidied.

Lets say we have a Defender named Teacher, who has AttackType Knowledge, if it attack Student1 he will deal 0.75x the damage, however if it attacks Student2, it will deal 1.25x the damage.
