This is how defender definiton file looks like. Everything is self explanatory except for AttackMode and AttackType.

AttackType is explained in the example attacker definition file.

AttackMode is a property that determines who will the defender attack. There are three (two) supported values.
    Furthest - the defender will attack the AttackerEntity that is furthest away
    AoW - it will attack all AttackerEntities in its radius
    Closest - will attack the one closest to it. This is also the default, if you for example make a type or type in a mode that is not supported, Closest will be used.
